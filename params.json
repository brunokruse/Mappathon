{"name":"Mappathon","tagline":"Mappathon 2013 Tutorial+Examples","body":"# Mappathon Examples\r\nSome examples on how to get Syphon+MadMapper talking together in OSX.\r\n\r\n## Processing\r\n1. Make sure to have MadMapper and processing 2.0b8 installed.\r\n2. Download the Syphon processing library from here: http://bit.ly/10WhdYq\r\n3. Unzip and copy the 'Syphon' folder to your Processing libraries folder.\r\n<pre>Documents -> Processing -> Libraries</pre>\r\n4. Download the Processing example above and copy to your Processing folder as well.\r\n5. Run the examples and view the Syphon output via MadMapper.\r\n\r\nAnything drawn between canvas.beginDraw() and canvas.endDraw() will be outputted to Syphon. Remember to use server.sendImage(canvas) at the end of your sketch to send to MaddMapper.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to port over more complex sketches remember to include the 'canvas.' prefix when drawing. A quick hack can be to use a PImage and get() to capture the screen context and send that through Syphon as an image. See the image and video sketches for an example of this.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n// you must call beginDraw() to render to the server\r\ncanvas.beginDraw();\r\n\r\n// all drawing calls are part of the PGraphics context\r\ncanvas.background(255);\r\ncanvas.stroke(0);\r\ncanvas.fill(175);\r\ncanvas.ellipse(x,y,32,32);\r\n\r\n// it's necessary to end the renderer with endDraw()\r\ncanvas.endDraw();\r\n\r\n// draw the buffer in your processing window\r\nimage(canvas, 0, 0);\r\n\r\n//send the buffer via syphon\r\nserver.sendImage(canvas);\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n## openFrameworks\r\n1. Clone the ofxSyphon addon into your addons folder. \r\n\r\n<pre>\r\ncd openFrameworks/addons/\r\ngit clone https://github.com/astellato/ofxSyphon\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n2. Copy the emptySyphonExample from the openFrameworks folder to your apps directory\r\n3. Make sure you place the example one level deep in your apps folder... for example:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nopenFrameworks -> apps -> mappathonExamples -> emptySyphonExample\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Max+Jitter\r\nMake sure you are using the latest version of Max 6.1\r\n\r\n1. Download the Max6 Syphon objects from: http://bit.ly/ZLnY5n\r\n2. Install the objects in your Cycling '74 directory (you can make a new folder for this)\r\n<pre>\r\nApplications -> Cycling '74 -> Your Folder\r\n</pre>\r\n3. Run the examples from above.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
